# Kronecker_EI

Matlab scripts to reproduce the results in [1].

Usage
-----
In order to reproduce the numerical results of the paper, run the following scripts:
* Example 1 - Heat equation --> P=1 in the data file and then main_Kron_2D.m
* Example 2 - Transient Eriksson-Johnson problem --> P=2 in the data file and then main_Kron_2D.m
* Example 3 - Allen-Cahn equation --> P=3 in the data file and then main_Kron_2D_phase.m
